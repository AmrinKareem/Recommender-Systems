# Recommender-Systems
ML701 Course Project, MBZUAI, 2022
A recommender system works like any other machine learning model. It takes in data, and outputs predictions. This project deals with collaborative filtering-based recommender systems for movies, where movie recommendations are based entirely on user-item ratings alone. Movie features such as genres or user demographics are not taken into consideration in this approach. The problem space can be defined as a combination of a prediction engine and a recommendation engine: given a user u, predict the user's rating for a given movie m; and given a user watched a movie m, recommend the next movies that they might watch. Our contribution is a comparative study of three common approaches to building recommender systems, namely Nearest Neighbors, Matrix Factorization, and Multi-layer Perceptrons, with a focus on the accuracy of predicted movie ratings.
